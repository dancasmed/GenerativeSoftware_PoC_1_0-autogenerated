The module should enable users to create, customize, and manage meal plans for each day of the week, ensuring they meet their dietary goals. Users should be able to input their dietary preferences, restrictions, and calorie targets. The module should automatically calculate the total calorie count for each day and the entire week, and generate a corresponding grocery list based on the selected meals. The grocery list should be organized by categories (e.g., produce, dairy, meat) for easy shopping. The module should also allow users to save and reuse meal plans, and provide options to adjust portion sizes and ingredients.\u0022,\n  \u0022functional_details\u0022: [\n    \u0022Create and customize weekly meal plans\u0022,\n    \u0022Track calorie counts for each meal and day\u0022,\n    \u0022Generate organized grocery lists based on selected meals\u0022,\n    \u0022Input dietary preferences, restrictions, and calorie targets\u0022,\n    \u0022Adjust portion sizes and ingredients\u0022,\n    \u0022Save and reuse meal plans\u0022\n  ],\n  \u0022user_interaction\u0022: [\n    \u0022User inputs dietary preferences and restrictions\u0022,\n    \u0022User sets calorie targets for the week\u0022,\n    \u0022User selects or creates meals for each day of the week\u0022,\n    \u0022User adjusts portion sizes and ingredients as needed\u0022,\n    \u0022User views the total calorie count for each day and the week\u0022,\n    \u0022User generates and views the grocery list\u0022,\n    \u0022User saves or reuses meal plans\u0022\n  ],\n  \u0022minimum_features\u0022: [\n    \u0022Create and manage weekly meal plans\u0022,\n    \u0022Calculate and display calorie counts\u0022,\n    \u0022Generate basic grocery lists\u0022,\n    \u0022Input dietary preferences and restrictions\u0022\n  ],\n  \u0022desired_features\u0022: [\n    \u0022Organize grocery lists by categories\u0022,\n    \u0022Adjust portion sizes and ingredients\u0022,\n    \u0022Save and reuse meal plans\u0022,\n    \u0022Provide nutritional information beyond calories (e.g., protein, carbs)\u0022\n  ],\n  \u0022bar_raiser_features\u0022: [\n    \u0022Integration with grocery delivery services\u0022,\n    \u0022Meal recommendations based on dietary goals\u0022,\n    \u0022Sync with fitness trackers for calorie tracking\u0022,\n    \u0022Multi-user support for family meal planning\u0022\n  ],\n  \u0022data_models\u0022: [\n    \u0022**Meal**: \u0060{id: string, name: string, description: string, ingredients: Ingredient[], calories: number, preparation_time: number, dietary_tags: string[]}\u0060\u0022,\n    \u0022**Ingredient**: \u0060{id: string, name: string, category: string, quantity: number, unit: string}\u0060\u0022,\n    \u0022**MealPlan**: \u0060{id: string, user_id: string, start_date: date, end_date: date, days: Day[]}\u0060\u0022,\n    \u0022**Day**: \u0060{date: date, meals: Meal[], total_calories: number}\u0060\u0022,\n    \u0022**GroceryList**: \u0060{id: string, meal_plan_id: string, items: GroceryItem[], total_items: number}\u0060\u0022,\n    \u0022**GroceryItem**: \u0060{id: string, ingredient_id: string, name: string, category: string, quantity: number, unit: string, checked: boolean}\u0060\u0022,\n    \u0022**User**: \u0060{id: string, name: string, dietary_preferences: string[], dietary_restrictions: string[], calorie_target: number}\u0060\u0022\n  ]\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060"
