  "reviewed_prompt": "Design a software module that allows users to plan their weekly meals, track calorie counts, and generate grocery lists. The module should enable users to create, customize, and manage meal plans for each day of the week, ensuring they meet their dietary goals. Users should be able to input their dietary preferences, restrictions, and calorie targets. The module should automatically calculate the total calorie count for each day and the entire week, and generate a corresponding grocery list based on the selected meals. The grocery list should be organized by categories (e.g., produce, dairy, meat) for easy shopping. The module should also allow users to save and reuse meal plans, and provide options to adjust portion sizes and ingredients.",
