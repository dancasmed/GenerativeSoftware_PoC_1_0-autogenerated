  "reviewed_prompt": "Design a software module to help teachers manage student attendance across multiple groups. The module should allow the teacher to create and manage groups of students, record daily attendance, and generate weekly attendance summaries. The teacher should be able to view and update attendance records for each group on a daily basis. At the end of the week, the module should automatically calculate and display the attendance percentage for each group. The system should ensure data integrity and provide an intuitive interface for the teacher to interact with the attendance records.",
