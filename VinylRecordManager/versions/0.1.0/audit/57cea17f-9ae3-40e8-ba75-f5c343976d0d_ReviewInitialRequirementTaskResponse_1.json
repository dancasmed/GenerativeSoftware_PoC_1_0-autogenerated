  "reviewed_prompt": "Design a software module to help users manage their vinyl records collection. The module should allow users to catalog their records, track their listening history, and manage their wishlist. Users should be able to add, edit, and delete records from their collection. Each record should include details such as artist, album title, release year, genre, and condition. Users should also be able to mark records as favorites and add personal notes. The module should provide a way to search and filter the collection based on various criteria. Additionally, users should be able to view statistics about their collection, such as the number of records per genre or the most listened-to records. The module should support importing and exporting the collection data for backup or sharing purposes.",
