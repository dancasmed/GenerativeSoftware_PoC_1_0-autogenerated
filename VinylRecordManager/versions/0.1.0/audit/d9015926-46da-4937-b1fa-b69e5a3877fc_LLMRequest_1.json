The module should allow users to catalog their records, track their listening history, and manage their wishlist. Users should be able to add, edit, and delete records from their collection. Each record should include details such as artist, album title, release year, genre, and condition. Users should also be able to mark records as favorites and add personal notes. The module should provide a way to search and filter the collection based on various criteria. Additionally, users should be able to view statistics about their collection, such as the number of records per genre or the most listened-to records. The module should support importing and exporting the collection data for backup or sharing purposes.\n## Funcional Details ##\nCatalog vinyl records with details like artist, album title, release year, genre, and condition\nTrack listening history for each record\nManage a wishlist of desired records\nMark records as favorites and add personal notes\nSearch and filter the collection based on various criteria\nView statistics about the collection\nImport and export collection data\n## Required features ## \nAdd, edit, and delete records\nBasic record details (artist, album title, release year, genre, condition)\nSearch and filter functionality\nMark records as favorites\n## User interaction ## \nAdd a new record to the collection\nEdit or delete an existing record\nMark a record as favorite\nAdd personal notes to a record\nSearch and filter the collection\nView collection statistics\nImport or export collection data\n## Suggested data models ##\nRecord: artist (string), albumTitle (string), releaseYear (number), genre (string), condition (string), isFavorite (boolean), notes (string)\nListeningHistory: recordId (string), listenDate (date), notes (string)\nWishlist: artist (string), albumTitle (string), releaseYear (number), genre (string), priority (string)\nStatistics: totalRecords (number), recordsByGenre (object), mostListened (array)"
