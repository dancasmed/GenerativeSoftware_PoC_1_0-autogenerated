    "ReviewedRequirement": "Design a software module to help users manage their vinyl record collections. The module should allow users to catalog their records, track their listening habits, and discover new music based on their collection. Users should be able to add, update, delete, and search records in their collection. The module should also provide insights into their collection, such as most listened-to records, genres, and artists. Additionally, the module should offer recommendations for new records based on the user\u0027s existing collection.",
